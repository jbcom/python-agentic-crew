# Quickstart

This guide will get you running your first agentic-crew in 5 minutes.

## 1. Install agentic-crew

```bash
pip install agentic-crew[crewai]
```

## 2. Define a Crew (YAML)

Create a minimal crew structure:

```bash
mkdir -p .crewai/crews/analyzer
```

**`.crewai/manifest.yaml`**:
```yaml
name: my-first-crew
version: "1.0"

crews:
  analyzer:
    description: Analyze code and provide feedback
    agents: crews/analyzer/agents.yaml
    tasks: crews/analyzer/tasks.yaml
```

**`crews/analyzer/agents.yaml`**:
```yaml
code_reviewer:
  role: Senior Code Reviewer
  goal: Review code for bugs, security issues, and improvements
  backstory: >
    You are an expert software engineer with 15 years of experience.
    You excel at finding subtle bugs and suggesting improvements.
```

**`crews/analyzer/tasks.yaml`**:
```yaml
review_code:
  description: Review the provided code for issues and improvements
  expected_output: >
    A detailed list of findings with:
    - Issue description
    - Severity (critical/high/medium/low)
    - Suggested fix
  agent: code_reviewer
```

## 3. Run Your Crew

### From Python

```python
from agentic_crew import run_crew

result = run_crew(
    "my-first-crew",
    "analyzer",
    inputs={"code": """
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item['price']
    return total
"""}
)

print(result)
```

### From CLI

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

agentic-crew run my-first-crew analyzer --input "Review this code: ..."
```

## 4. Try Different Frameworks

agentic-crew auto-detects available frameworks:

```python
from agentic_crew.core.decomposer import detect_framework, get_available_frameworks

# See what you have installed
print(get_available_frameworks())  # ['crewai', 'langgraph']

# Force a specific framework
result = run_crew(
    "my-first-crew",
    "analyzer",
    inputs={"code": "..."},
    framework="langgraph"  # Force LangGraph
)
```

## Common Patterns

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

```yaml
# agents.yaml
planner:
  role: Project Planner
  goal: Break down complex tasks

implementer:
  role: Code Implementer
  goal: Write production code

reviewer:
  role: Code Reviewer
  goal: Ensure quality

# tasks.yaml
plan:
  description: Create implementation plan
  agent: planner

implement:
  description: Write the code
  agent: implementer
  context: [plan]  # Use planner's output

review:
  description: Review implementation
  agent: reviewer
  context: [implement]  # Use implementer's output
```

### Knowledge Base Integration

```yaml
# manifest.yaml
crews:
  analyzer:
    description: Analyze code with domain knowledge
    agents: crews/analyzer/agents.yaml
    tasks: crews/analyzer/tasks.yaml
    knowledge:
      - knowledge/coding_standards/
      - knowledge/security_guidelines/
```

### Single-Agent CLI Execution

For simple tasks that don't need multi-agent coordination:

```bash
# Quick fixes with aider
agentic-crew run --runner aider --input "Add error handling to auth.py"

# Free local execution with Ollama
agentic-crew run --runner ollama --input "Fix the bug" --model deepseek-coder
```
