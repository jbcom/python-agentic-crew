"""Single-agent runner base class.

Single-agent runners execute simple, sequential tasks without multi-agent
collaboration overhead. They're ideal for:
- Quick file edits
- Code generation
- Local development
- Sequential workflows

Unlike multi-agent crews, single-agent runners:
- Take a single task string as input
- Execute in one pass without delegation
- Return results directly
- Have minimal configuration overhead
